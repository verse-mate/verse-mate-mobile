## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **EAS CLI Installed**
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   eas login
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export EXPO_TOKEN="your-expo-token"
   ```

3. **Credentials Configured** (one-time setup)
   ```bash
   eas credentials
   ```
   See [SETUP_CREDENTIALS.md](./SETUP_CREDENTIALS.md) for detailed instructions.

### Trigger a Build

**Preview Build (Local Testing):**
```bash
# Build iOS preview
bash .deployment/build-preview.sh

# Submit to TestFlight
bash .deployment/submit-testflight.sh <build-id>
```

**Production Build (App Store Release):**
```bash
# Via GitHub Actions (recommended)
# 1. Create version tag: git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
# 2. Go to GitHub Actions → "Expo Production Build" → Run workflow

# Via Local Script
bash .deployment/build-production.sh

# Download for testing
bash .deployment/download-build.sh <build-id>
```

---

## Deployment Scripts

All scripts are located in `.deployment/` directory and are used by both CI/CD and local development.

### `build-preview.sh`

Triggers an iOS preview build on EAS.

**Purpose**: Internal testing builds that automatically submit to TestFlight

**Usage:**
```bash
export EXPO_TOKEN="your-expo-token"
bash .deployment/build-preview.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Triggers EAS build with `preview` profile
- Uses `store` distribution for TestFlight compatibility
- Captures build ID and saves to `build_id.txt`
- Outputs build ID to stdout and `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (if in CI)

**Output:**
```
Starting iOS preview build...
Build started successfully!
Build ID: abc123-def456-ghi789
View build: https://expo.dev/accounts/versemate/projects/verse-mate-mobile/builds/abc123-def456-ghi789
abc123-def456-ghi789
```

**Profile:** Uses `preview` profile from eas.json:
- Distribution: `store`
- Channel: `preview`
- Environment: `APP_ENV=preview`

### `build-production.sh`

Triggers an iOS production build on EAS.

**Purpose**: Production-ready builds for App Store release

**Usage:**
```bash
export EXPO_TOKEN="your-expo-token"
bash .deployment/build-production.sh
```

**What it does:**
- Triggers EAS build with `production` profile
- Uses `store` distribution for App Store
- Captures build ID and saves to `build_id_production.txt`
- Outputs build ID to stdout and `$GITHUB_OUTPUT` (if in CI)

**Profile:** Uses `production` profile from eas.json:
- Distribution: `store`
- Channel: `production`
- Environment: `APP_ENV=production`
- Android: Builds AAB (App Bundle) instead of APK

### `submit-testflight.sh`

Waits for a build to complete and submits it to TestFlight.

**Purpose**: Automated TestFlight submission for preview builds

**Usage:**
```bash
export EXPO_TOKEN="your-expo-token"
bash .deployment/submit-testflight.sh <build-id>
```

**What it does:**
1. Polls build status every 30 seconds (max 45 minutes)
2. Waits for build status to be `FINISHED`
3. Automatically submits to TestFlight using EAS credentials
4. Uses credentials from EAS credentials storage (no hardcoded values needed)

**Credentials:**
- Reads from EAS credentials storage automatically
- No need for environment variables or eas.json configuration
- Uses App Store Connect API Key configured via `eas credentials`

**Success Output:**
```
Checking build status for: abc123-def456-ghi789
Build status: FINISHED
Build is ready! Submitting to TestFlight...
Submission successful!
Submission ID: xyz789-uvw456-rst123
```

### `download-build.sh`

Downloads a completed build from EAS for local testing.

**Purpose**: Download production builds for manual testing before App Store submission

**Usage:**
```bash
export EXPO_TOKEN="your-expo-token"
bash .deployment/download-build.sh <build-id>
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks build status (must be `FINISHED`)
2. Retrieves artifact download URL
3. Downloads IPA (iOS) or AAB (Android) file
4. Saves as `verse-mate-mobile-{build-id}.{extension}`

**Output:**
```
Checking build status for: abc123-def456-ghi789
Platform: IOS
Status: FINISHED
Downloading build to: verse-mate-mobile-abc123de.ipa
Build downloaded successfully!
File: verse-mate-mobile-abc123de.ipa
Size: 45M

Next steps:
  1. Install on device via Xcode: Window > Devices and Simulators
  2. Or manually submit to App Store: eas submit --platform ios --id abc123-def456-ghi789
```

## Configuration

### EAS Credentials Storage

VerseMate Mobile uses EAS credentials storage for secure credential management.

**What's Stored:**
- App Store Connect API Key (Key ID, Issuer ID, .p8 file)
- iOS Distribution Certificate
- iOS Provisioning Profiles
- (Future: Google Play Service Account JSON)

**Benefits:**
- No credentials in repository
- No hardcoded values in eas.json
- Automatic credential usage for all builds
- Team-friendly - shared across project
- Secure - encrypted on EAS servers

**Setup:**
```bash
# One-time setup
eas credentials

# Follow interactive prompts:
# 1. Select iOS
# 2. Select "App Store Connect API Key"
# 3. Enter Key ID, Issuer ID, .p8 file path
# 4. Credentials stored securely
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# View configured credentials
eas credentials

# Test with build
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
# Should work without any additional configuration
```

See [SETUP_CREDENTIALS.md](./SETUP_CREDENTIALS.md) for detailed setup guide.

### GitHub Secrets

Required secrets for GitHub Actions workflows:

| Secret | Purpose | Where to Get |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| `EXPO_TOKEN` | EAS CLI authentication | `eas whoami` (after login) |

**iOS-specific secrets** (stored in EAS credentials, not GitHub):
- App Store Connect API Key managed via `eas credentials`
- No additional GitHub secrets needed for iOS builds/submissions

**How to Add Secrets:**
1. Go to repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Add name and value
4. Secrets are encrypted and accessible only to workflows

### Build Configuration (eas.json)

**Key Settings:**

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 14.0.0",
    "appVersionSource": "remote"
  },
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "store",  // Required for TestFlight
      "channel": "preview",
      "env": {
        "APP_ENV": "preview"  // Accessible in app via process.env
      }
    },
    "production": {
      "distribution": "store",
      "channel": "production",
      "android": {
        "buildType": "app-bundle"  // AAB for Play Store
      }
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "preview": {
      "ios": {
        "ascAppId": "6754565256"  // App Store Connect App ID
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes:**
- `distribution: "store"` is required for TestFlight (not "internal")
- `appVersionSource: "remote"` uses app.json version (managed manually)
- Credentials not needed in submit config (uses EAS storage)
- `ascAppId` is the App Store Connect App ID (numeric)

### App Configuration (app.json)

**Critical Settings:**

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "name": "verse-mate-mobile",
    "version": "0.1.0",  // Manually managed
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "org.versemate.mobile",
      "infoPlist": {
        "ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption": false  // Export compliance
      }
    },
    "android": {
      "package": "org.versemate.mobile"
    }
  }
}
```

**Version Management:**
- Manual version bumping (no automation)
- Update version before creating production tag
- Version must match tag (e.g., version "1.0.0" → tag v1.0.0)

## Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnostics

**Build Fails Immediately:**
```bash
# Check credentials
eas credentials

# Verify eas.json syntax
cat eas.json | jq .

# Check EAS project
eas whoami
```

**"Invalid Provisioning Profile" Error:**
- Problem: Build used `distribution: "internal"` but TestFlight requires `"store"`
- Solution: Verify eas.json has `"distribution": "store"` for preview/production
- Reference: `.deployment/README.md` line 99

**"Could not find credentials" Error:**
- Problem: EAS credentials not configured
- Solution: Run `eas credentials` and configure App Store Connect API Key
- Guide: [SETUP_CREDENTIALS.md](./SETUP_CREDENTIALS.md)

**Build Succeeds but Submission Fails:**
```bash
# Check build details
eas build:view <build-id>

# Verify ascAppId in eas.json
grep -A 5 "submit" eas.json

# Test submission manually
eas submit --platform ios --id <build-id>
```

**GitHub Actions Workflow Fails:**
- Check EXPO_TOKEN secret is set
- Verify syntax in workflow YAML
- Check build logs for specific error
- Ensure all required secrets configured

## Best Practices

### Build Management

**Development Builds:**
- Use for local debugging only
- Don't distribute to testers
- Keep on local machine or simulator

**Preview Builds:**
- Test every major feature/fix
- Distribute via TestFlight to internal testers
- Test on physical devices
- Verify functionality before production

**Production Builds:**
- Create from tagged releases only
- Test thoroughly before submission
- Download and validate locally first
- Never auto-submit to app stores
- Monitor closely after release

### Credential Security

**Do:**
- Store credentials in EAS credentials storage
- Use GitHub Secrets for CI/CD tokens
- Rotate credentials periodically (every 12 months)
- Limit access to production credentials

**Don't:**
- Commit credentials to repository
- Share EXPO_TOKEN publicly
- Hardcode credentials in scripts
- Store .p8 files in version control

### Version Control

**Tagging:**
```bash
# Good: Descriptive tag with message
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Version 1.0.0 - Feature description"

# Bad: No message
git tag v1.0.0
```

**Version Numbers:**
- Follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Update app.json before tagging
- Keep version consistent across platforms
- Document changes in commit message or changelog

### Testing

**Before Preview Build:**
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Core features work on simulator

**Before Production Build:**
- [ ] Preview build tested on physical devices
- [ ] All stakeholders approved
- [ ] No critical bugs
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Deep linking tested
- [ ] App Store metadata prepared

## Build Quota Management

### EAS Build Free Tier

**Limits:**
- Varies by plan (check https://expo.dev/pricing)
- Shared across all projects in account
- Resets monthly

**Current Strategy:**
- Manual triggers only (no automatic builds on push)
- Conserve quota by building only when needed
- Use local builds for rapid development

**Monitoring:**
```bash
# Check build usage
eas build:list --limit 30

# View account details
eas account:view
```

**When to Upgrade:**
- Approaching quota limit regularly
- Need faster build times
- Require higher concurrency
- Team growth requires more builds

**Paid Tier Benefits:**
- More builds per month
- Faster build queues
- Priority support
- Higher concurrency

### Build Optimization Tips

**Reduce Build Frequency:**
- Test locally before triggering cloud builds
- Batch changes instead of building for each commit
- Use development builds for debugging

**Use Appropriate Profiles:**
- Development: Local testing only
- Preview: Feature testing and QA
- Production: Releases only

**Monitor Build Times:**
- Typical: 15-30 minutes per platform
- Longer builds may indicate issues
- Check build logs for unnecessary steps
