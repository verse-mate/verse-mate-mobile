# Bible Reading Critical Path E2E Test
#
# This flow tests the primary use case: User opens app and reads Genesis 1 in Bible view
#
# User Journey:
# 1. Launch app (redirects to Genesis 1 in Bible view)
# 2. Verify Genesis 1 chapter loads
# 3. Verify Bible verses are visible (no tabs in Bible view)
# 4. Verify view switcher icons work

- runFlow: ../shared/setup.yaml

# Wait for app to fully load (either Bible chapter or Topic screen)
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible:
      id: "chapter-selector-button"
    timeout: 30000

# Now verify we're on a chapter screen
- assertVisible:
    id: "chapter-selector-button"

# Wait for content to load
- waitForAnimationToEnd


# Verify Bible view icon is present (testID)
- assertVisible:
    id: "bible-view-toggle"

# Verify Explanations view icon is present
- assertVisible:
    id: "commentary-view-toggle"

# First, ensure we're in Bible view by tapping the Bible view icon
- tapOn:
    id: "bible-view-toggle"

- waitForAnimationToEnd


# Tabs should NOT be visible in Bible view (key differentiator)
- assertNotVisible:
    id: "chapter-content-tabs"

# Switch to Explanations view
- tapOn:
    id: "commentary-view-toggle"

# Tabs should now be visible in Explanations view
- assertVisible:
    id: "tab-summary"

# Verify chapter selector button still visible after view switch
- assertVisible:
    id: "chapter-selector-button"
