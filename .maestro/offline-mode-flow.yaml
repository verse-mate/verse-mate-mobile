# Offline Mode E2E Test
#
# This flow tests offline functionality:
# - Read cached content offline
# - Display offline indicator
# - Show error when navigating to uncached content
# - Handle network reconnection
#
# User Journey:
# 1. Launch app online and load Genesis 1
# 2. Enable airplane mode (offline)
# 3. Verify offline indicator appears
# 4. Read cached content (should work)
# 5. Try to navigate to uncached chapter (should fail gracefully)
# 6. Disable airplane mode (online)
# 7. Verify navigation works again

# Wait for app to load online
- assertVisible: "Genesis 1"

# Verify content loaded
- assertVisible:

# Enable airplane mode to go offline

    adb shell cmd connectivity airplane-mode enable

# Wait for offline detection
