# This flow tests the primary use case: User opens app and reads Genesis 1
#
# User Journey:
# 1. Launch app (redirects to Genesis 1)
# 2. Verify Genesis 1 chapter loads
# 3. Verify content and tabs are visible
# 4. Verify verses are readable

- launchApp:
    appId: com.versemate.mobile
    clearState: true

# App redirects to Genesis 1
- assertVisible: "Genesis 1"

# Verify section heading is visible
- assertVisible: "The Creation"

# Verify tabs are visible using testIDs
- assertVisible:
    id: "tab-summary"
- assertVisible:
    id: "tab-byline"
- assertVisible:
    id: "tab-detailed"

# Verify first verse is visible
- assertVisible:
    text: ".*In the beginning God created.*"
