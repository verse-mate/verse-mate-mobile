# Boundary Testing for Swipe Navigation
#
# This flow tests navigation boundaries:
# - At Genesis 1: right swipe should not navigate (stay on Genesis 1)
# - At Revelation 22: left swipe should not navigate (stay on Revelation 22)
#
# User Journey:
# 1. Launch app to Genesis 1
# 2. Try to swipe right (should stay on Genesis 1)
# 3. Navigate to Revelation 22
# 4. Try to swipe left (should stay on Revelation 22)
