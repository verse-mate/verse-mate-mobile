> Date: 2025-09-21
> Spec: /Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/.agent-os/specs/2025-09-21-project-dev-setup
> Status: COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully established a complete development environment with automated code quality tools, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD pipeline for the VerseMate mobile app. This comprehensive setup includes Biome.js for fast formatting and core linting, ESLint with Expo configuration for React Native-specific rules, Husky git hooks, lint-staged pre-commit validation, Bun test framework, and GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## Completed Features

### Core Development Tools Setup
- **Biome.js Integration**: Installed and configured @biomejs/biome with React Native/TypeScript rules, 2-space indentation, single quotes, trailing commas, and import organization
- **ESLint Configuration**: Set up eslint with eslint-config-expo for React Native platform support and eslint-config-biome to prevent conflicts using flat config format for Expo SDK 53+
- **Husky Git Hooks**: Initialized Husky with pre-commit hooks for lint-staged and pre-push hooks for TypeScript type checking
- **Lint-staged Configuration**: Configured staged file processing with execution order - Biome.js first, then ESLint for React Native rules

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Bun Testing Framework**: Set up Bun test environment with @testing-library/react-native for component testing and @testing-library/jest-dom for custom matchers
- **Test Configuration**: Configured Bun test settings with TypeScript support, custom matchers, and proper test file patterns
- **Example Tests**: Created sample component and utility function tests to validate setup and React Native Testing Library integration

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Created comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with workflow triggers for PR and push to main/develop branches
- **Quality Check Steps**: Added TypeScript type checking (tsc --noEmit), Biome.js formatting/linting (biome ci), ESLint React Native rules (eslint .), and Bun test execution
- **Performance Optimization**: Implemented Bun cache strategy, parallel job execution, and proper error reporting for faster builds

### Documentation and Integration
- **Package.json Scripts**: Added comprehensive scripts for format, lint, lint:fix, type-check, test, and prepare commands
- **Development Documentation**: Updated README with setup instructions, documented bun scripts, created troubleshooting guide, and code style guidelines
- **VS Code Integration**: Created .vscode/settings.json with Biome.js extension recommendations and format on save configuration

### Testing and Validation
- **End-to-End Testing**: Validated complete workflow from clone to push, verified pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits, and confirmed GitHub Actions workflow runs correctly
- **Team Onboarding**: Documented new developer onboarding process and tested setup on clean environment
- **Performance Verification**: Measured build times, verified lint-staged performance, and optimized CI pipeline performance

## Key Achievements

1. **Automated Code Quality**: Established dual-layer linting with Biome.js for fast formatting/core rules and ESLint for React Native-specific platform support without conflicts
2. **Pre-commit Validation**: Implemented Husky and lint-staged to prevent bad code from reaching the repository with proper execution order
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Set up Bun test framework with React Native Testing Library for reliable unit testing
4. **CI/CD Automation**: Created GitHub Actions pipeline that validates all pull requests with comprehensive checks (lint, type-check, tests)
5. **Developer Experience**: Configured VS Code integration and documented complete onboarding process for new team members

## Technical Implementation

- **Biome.js**: Configured for fast formatting and core linting with React Native/TypeScript rules
- **ESLint**: Set up with flat config format using eslint-config-expo and eslint-config-biome
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hooks for lint-staged, pre-push hooks for TypeScript checking
- **Lint-staged**: Staged file processing with Biome first, then ESLint execution order
- **Bun Test**: React Native compatible test environment with TypeScript support
- **GitHub Actions**: Comprehensive CI pipeline with Bun caching and parallel execution

## Impact

This development setup ensures code quality, prevents regressions, and enables efficient team development with automated validation at every stage. New developers can now clone the repository, run `bun install`, and immediately have access to automated code formatting, pre-commit validation, comprehensive testing, and CI/CD confidence.
