# [2025-10-03] Recap: Testing Infrastructure

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-10-03-testing-infrastructure/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented a comprehensive testing infrastructure optimized for AI-driven development, completing Tasks 1-3 of the specification. The infrastructure includes Jest with React Native Testing Library for unit and integration testing with 60% minimum coverage thresholds, Storybook with Chromatic integration for visual regression testing, and MSW for API mocking. All 48 example tests are passing successfully.

Key accomplishments:
- **Jest Testing Foundation**: Configured Jest with React Native preset, coverage thresholds (60% min, 80% target), example component tests, and accessibility tests using jest-native matchers
- **Storybook Visual Testing**: Set up Storybook for React Native with on-device addons, Chromatic CLI for visual regression, and example component stories for Button and VerseCard
- **MSW API Mocking**: Created MSW server with mock data factories for Bible verses and AI explanations, handlers for VerseMate API endpoints, and example tests demonstrating API interaction patterns
- **AI Testing Standards**: Comprehensive documentation for AI-driven test generation with prompts, patterns, and best practices for components, accessibility, API mocking, and visual testing

## Context

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure (Jest, Storybook+Chromatic, Maestro) optimized for AI-driven development. Enable AI tools to write, run, and validate tests automatically with 60% minimum coverage, visual regression testing, E2E flows, and accessibility validation.
