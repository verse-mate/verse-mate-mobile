# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Project Development Setup
> Created: 2025-09-21
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Establish a complete development environment with automated code quality tools, testing infrastructure, and CI/CD pipeline to enable efficient team development on the VerseMate mobile app. This setup will include Biome.js for fast formatting and core linting, ESLint with eslint-config-expo for React Native/Expo-specific rules, eslint-config-biome to prevent conflicts, Husky for git hooks, lint-staged for pre-commit validation, Bun test framework, and GitHub Actions for automated validation.

## User Stories

### Development Team Onboarding
As a new developer joining the VerseMate mobile team, I want a fully configured development environment with automated code quality checks, so that I can start contributing to features immediately without worrying about code style inconsistencies or breaking existing functionality.

The developer will clone the repository, run bun install, and immediately have access to: automated code formatting on save, pre-commit hooks that prevent bad code from being committed, a comprehensive test suite they can run locally, and confidence that their pull requests will pass CI/CD validation.

### Code Quality Assurance
As a team lead, I want automated code quality enforcement at multiple stages (local development, pre-commit, and CI/CD), so that the codebase maintains consistent quality and style standards as the team grows.

This ensures that all code follows TypeScript/React Native best practices, passes linting rules, maintains proper formatting, and includes appropriate test coverage before being merged to main branches.

### Continuous Integration Confidence
As a developer, I want automated testing and validation in GitHub Actions, so that I can trust that my changes won't break the build or existing functionality when merged.

Every pull request will automatically run linting, type checking, and the full test suite, providing immediate feedback and preventing regressions from reaching the main branch.

## Spec Scope

1. **Biome.js Integration** - Install and configure Biome.js for fast formatting, import organization, and core linting with React Native/TypeScript rules
2. **Husky Git Hooks** - Set up pre-commit and pre-push hooks to enforce code quality before commits reach the repository
3. **Lint-staged Configuration** - Configure lint-staged to run Biome.js and TypeScript checks only on staged files for fast pre-commit validation
4. **Bun Testing Setup** - Configure Bun test with React Native Testing Library, including example tests and proper TypeScript support
5. **ESLint Configuration** - Configure ESLint with eslint-config-expo for React Native platform-specific support and eslint-config-biome to prevent conflicts with Biome.js
6. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Create CI/CD pipeline that runs Biome, ESLint, type checking, and tests on pull requests and main branch pushes

## Out of Scope

- Advanced testing configurations (E2E testing, visual regression testing)
- Deployment automation (handled separately by EAS)
- Code coverage reporting setup
- Advanced ESLint rules beyond Biome.js defaults
- Editor-specific configurations beyond standard VS Code settings

## Expected Deliverable

1. New developers can clone the repo, run bun install, and immediately have all development tools working with proper code formatting and validation
2. Pre-commit hooks prevent commits that fail linting, type checking, or basic formatting requirements
3. GitHub Actions workflow validates all pull requests with comprehensive checks (lint, tsc, tests) and provides clear feedback on any failures
