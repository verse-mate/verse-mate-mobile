# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a comprehensive Bible reading interface for the VerseMate mobile app that allows users to navigate through testaments, books, and chapters with an intuitive, mobile-optimized experience. The interface will provide hierarchical navigation (Testament → Book → Chapter), verse-by-verse text display with proper formatting, and gesture-based navigation with swipe controls for seamless chapter transitions.

## Key Technical Highlights

- **Enhanced Cross-Book Navigation**: Seamless transitions between books (Genesis→Exodus, Malachi→Matthew) - feature not present in current webapp
- **Dual Navigation System**: Both gesture-based swiping AND floating button controls for maximum accessibility
- **Complete Chapter Display**: Full chapter content without pagination or infinite scroll for uninterrupted reading
- **Testament Filter with Global Search**: Toggle-based testament filtering combined with universal chapter search across all books
- **Mobile-First Design**: React Native implementation with webapp design system consistency (MerriweatherItalic, Roboto Serif, #b09a6d accent)
- **Smart Loading & Error Handling**: Skeleton screens for loading states and retry functionality for network failures
- **Visual Reference Tooling**: AI-powered screenshot capture from web app (https://app.versemate.org) to ensure design consistency during implementation
