# Testing Infrastructure - Lite Summary

Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure (Jest, Storybook+Chromatic, Maestro) optimized for AI-driven development. Enable AI tools to write, run, and validate tests automatically with 60% minimum coverage, visual regression testing, E2E flows, and accessibility validation.

## Key Points
- AI-automated test generation with Jest + React Native Testing Library (60% min, 80% target coverage)
- Visual regression testing with Storybook + Chromatic for UI validation
- E2E testing with Maestro, accessibility validation, and MSW API mocking
- CI/CD integration blocking merges on test failures with documented AI testing standards
