## Overview

Implement a comprehensive testing infrastructure that enables AI-driven development with automated test generation, execution, and validation. The infrastructure will include unit and integration testing with Jest and React Native Testing Library, visual regression testing with Storybook and Chromatic, end-to-end testing with Maestro, and accessibility validation. This infrastructure is optimized for AI tools to autonomously write, run, and maintain tests while ensuring code quality through enforced coverage thresholds and CI/CD integration.

## User Stories

**As an AI developer**, I want to automatically write and run comprehensive tests for components, screens, and utilities so that I can validate my code changes without human intervention.

**As a developer**, I want to review visual changes through Chromatic so that I can catch unintended UI regressions before they reach production.

**As a QA engineer**, I want to test critical user flows with Maestro so that I can ensure end-to-end functionality works correctly on real devices and simulators.

**As a product owner**, I want automated accessibility testing so that our app meets WCAG standards and is usable by all users.

## Spec Scope

1. **Jest + React Native Testing Library**: Configure Jest with React Native preset for unit and integration testing. Implement 60% minimum coverage threshold (statements, branches, functions, lines) with 80% target coverage. Include react-test-renderer for component snapshot testing.

2. **Storybook + Chromatic for Visual Regression**: Set up Storybook React Native for component development and visual testing. Integrate Chromatic for automated visual regression detection. Enable AI to automatically update snapshots when intentional changes are made.

3. **Maestro for E2E Testing**: Install and configure Maestro CLI for end-to-end testing. Create flows for critical user journeys. Local execution only for this phase (Maestro Cloud integration deferred).

4. **Accessibility Testing**: Integrate @testing-library/jest-native accessibility matchers. Ensure all UI components and screens include accessibility validation tests (labels, roles, states, contrast).

5. **MSW for API Mocking**: Configure Mock Service Worker for API request interception and mocking. Use production-like data structures to ensure realistic test scenarios. Support both test environment and Storybook integration.

6. **CI/CD Integration**: Create GitHub Actions workflow to run all tests on pull requests. Block merges to main branch on test failures or coverage drops below minimum threshold. Generate and publish coverage reports.

7. **AI Test Generation Templates and Standards**: Document standardized patterns, naming conventions, and templates for AI-generated tests. Include examples for components, screens, hooks, and utilities. Establish self-documenting test structures.

## Out of Scope

- **Performance Testing**: Manual performance testing will continue for this phase. Automated performance regression testing is deferred to future work.

- **Maestro Cloud Integration**: Cloud-based E2E testing on multiple devices will be implemented in a future phase. Current scope is local execution only.

- **Automated Performance Regression**: Lighthouse scores, bundle size tracking, and render performance regression testing are out of scope for this iteration.

## Expected Deliverable

1. **All Test Frameworks Configured and Running**: Jest, Storybook, Chromatic, Maestro, and MSW fully configured with working example tests. All frameworks integrated with npm scripts for easy execution.

2. **Example Tests for UI Components and Screens**: Comprehensive example tests demonstrating best practices for components (visual + accessibility), screens (user interactions), hooks, and utilities. AI can use these as templates for generating new tests.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Blocking Bad Merges to Main**: GitHub Actions workflow running on all PRs, executing full test suite, generating coverage reports, and blocking merges when tests fail or coverage drops below 60%.

4. **AI Test Generation Standards Documented**: Complete documentation of AI testing standards including prompts, templates, naming conventions, file organization, mock data management, and self-documenting patterns. Enable AI tools to generate consistent, high-quality tests.
