**Goal**: Install and configure Playwright with TypeScript support for web app automation

**Completion Criteria**: Playwright installed, config file created, Chromium browser ready, basic test script runs successfully

- [x] 1.1. Install Playwright dependencies (`@playwright/test`, `playwright`) and install Chromium browser
- [x] 1.2. Create `playwright.config.ts` with TypeScript configuration, custom timeouts, and viewport settings for desktop/tablet/mobile
- [x] 1.3. Set up TypeScript types for Playwright and configure tsconfig paths if needed
- [x] 1.4. Create basic smoke test script to verify Playwright can navigate to https://app.versemate.org/bible
- [x] 1.5. Add NPM scripts for running Playwright in headless and headed modes
- [x] 1.6. Configure gitignore entries for Playwright artifacts (test-results, playwright-report)
- [x] 1.7. Document Playwright setup in project README or tooling documentation
- [x] 1.8. Verify Playwright successfully captures screenshot of VerseMate homepage

### 2. Core Capture Utilities and Metadata Extraction

**Goal**: Build foundational screenshot capture system with metadata extraction capabilities

**Completion Criteria**: Can capture multi-viewport screenshots and extract HTML/CSS metadata from any URL

- 2.1. Write manual validation tests for metadata extraction accuracy (verify extracted styles match browser DevTools)
- 2.2. Create `scripts/capture/utils/screenshot-capture.ts` with viewport configuration (desktop 1920x1080, tablet 768x1024, mobile 375x667)
- 2.3. Implement full-page screenshot capture function with PNG quality settings and file naming convention
- 2.4. Create `scripts/capture/utils/extract-metadata.ts` with HTML structure extraction using recursive tree traversal
- 2.5. Implement CSS style extraction using `window.getComputedStyle()` for typography, colors, spacing, and layout
- 2.6. Build design token extraction for CSS custom properties (colors, fonts, spacing, borders, shadows)
- 2.7. Create `scripts/capture/utils/generate-reference.ts` to output metadata as JSON and formatted markdown
- 2.8. Verify screenshot quality, metadata accuracy, and markdown formatting with manual spot-checks

### 3. Single Page Capture System and NPM Scripts

**Goal**: Enable automated capture of individual pages with complete metadata and multi-viewport screenshots

**Completion Criteria**: `npm run capture:page` successfully captures any web app page with screenshots and metadata

- 3.1. Write error handling tests for network failures, timeouts, and missing elements
- 3.2. Create `scripts/capture/capture-page.ts` that accepts URL and name parameters
- 3.3. Implement parallel viewport screenshot capture for performance optimization
- 3.4. Integrate metadata extraction and reference markdown generation into page capture workflow
- 3.5. Set up storage organization with `screenshots/`, `metadata/`, and `reference.md` structure
- 3.6. Add NPM script `capture:page` with CLI argument parsing (--url, --name)
- 3.7. Create `capture:responsive` script for multi-viewport automation of single pages
- 3.8. Verify page capture works on Bible reader page (https://app.versemate.org/bible/1/1) and generates complete artifacts

### 4. Journey Recording System and Interactive Command

**Goal**: Implement interactive journey capture with AI-assisted selector finding and step-by-step screenshot recording

**Completion Criteria**: `/capture-journey` command works interactively to record user flows and generates replayable TypeScript journey files

- 4.1. Write validation tests for journey file generation (verify TypeScript syntax and journey data structure)
- 4.2. Define TypeScript interfaces for `JourneyStep` and `Journey` in `scripts/capture/types/journey.ts`
- 4.3. Create `scripts/capture/utils/selector-finder.ts` for AI-assisted CSS selector identification from element descriptions
- 4.4. Build `scripts/capture/capture-journey-interactive.ts` with step-by-step prompting (click, navigate, type, scroll, done)
- 4.5. Implement screenshot capture after each journey step with descriptive file naming (step-1-landing.png, step-2-select-testament.png)
- 4.6. Create journey file generator that outputs TypeScript journey definition files to `.agent-os/references/journeys/{name}/`
- 4.7. Add Claude command documentation at `@.agent-os/commands/capture-journey.md` with usage examples and interactive flow
- 4.8. Verify interactive journey capture creates valid TypeScript file and complete screenshot sequence

### 5. Journey Replay, Example Captures, and Documentation

**Goal**: Complete automation system with journey replay, example captures, and storage organization

**Completion Criteria**: Journey replay works, Bible reader example exists, documentation complete, storage properly configured

- 5.1. Write replay validation tests to ensure saved journeys execute correctly
- 5.2. Create `scripts/capture/capture-journey-replay.ts` that imports and executes journey definition files
- 5.3. Add NPM script `capture:journey` for replaying journeys (--journey parameter)
- 5.4. Set up `.agent-os/references/` directory structure with `examples/` and `journeys/` subdirectories
- 5.5. Configure gitignore to exclude all references except curated examples and journey definitions
- 5.6. Capture Bible reader page example at https://app.versemate.org/bible/1/1 and save to `.agent-os/references/examples/bible-reader/`
- 5.7. Create basic user journey example (Bible navigation to Genesis 1) and save to `.agent-os/references/journeys/bible-reading-flow/`
- 5.8. Verify all NPM scripts work, examples are complete, journey replay functions, and all tests pass
