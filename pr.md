## Title
feat: Complete development environment setup

## Summary

Complete development environment setup for VerseMate Mobile with comprehensive tooling:

- **Biome.js**: Fast formatting and core linting with 2-space indentation and single quotes
- **ESLint**: React Native specific rules with platform support (.ios.js, .android.js, .web.js)
- **Husky**: Git hooks for pre-commit (lint-staged) and pre-push (TypeScript check)
- **lint-staged**: Efficient processing of staged files (Biome first, then ESLint)
- **Bun Testing**: Test framework with React Native Testing Library support
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline with quality checks and Bun caching
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with setup, scripts, and troubleshooting
- **VS Code**: Complete workspace integration with recommended extensions

## Test Plan

- [x] All linting and formatting tools work correctly
- [x] Pre-commit hooks prevent commits with issues
- [x] Pre-push hooks validate TypeScript compilation
- [x] Bun tests run successfully
- [x] GitHub Actions CI pipeline validates PR (will test with this PR)
- [x] VS Code integration configured
- [x] Documentation complete with troubleshooting guide
