# Task 4: Chapter Reading Screen (Core Functionality)

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #4 from `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/specs/2025-10-14-bible-reading-mobile/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** UI Designer Agent
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement the core chapter reading screen for the Bible Reading Mobile Interface. This includes creating the routing infrastructure, building the chapter display component, implementing a fixed header with action icons, integrating with existing API hooks, persisting reading position, and rendering Bible text with markdown support for explanations.

## Implementation Summary

I successfully implemented the Chapter Reading Screen, which serves as the primary reading interface for the Bible mobile app. The implementation focuses on creating a clean, accessible reading experience with proper loading states, error handling, and reading position persistence.

The solution leverages Expo Router for file-based routing (`/bible/[bookId]/[chapterNumber]`), existing React Query hooks for data fetching, and the AsyncStorage-based `useActiveTab` hook for tab persistence. The screen displays a fixed header with placeholder action buttons, scrollable chapter content rendered by the `ChapterReader` component, and shows a skeleton loader during data fetching.

The `ChapterReader` component renders Bible text with proper typography hierarchy (chapter titles, section subtitles, verse numbers as superscripts) and supports markdown rendering for explanation content using the `react-native-markdown-display` library. All components follow the established design tokens system and accessibility standards.

## Key Implementation Details

### Chapter Screen Route (`app/bible/[bookId]/[chapterNumber].tsx`)
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/app/bible/[bookId]/[chapterNumber].tsx`

The main chapter screen component handles routing, data fetching, loading states, and layout orchestration. Key features include:

- **Route Parameter Validation**: Extracts `bookId` and `chapterNumber` from URL params, validates them (1-66 for bookId, minimum 1 for chapter), and redirects to Genesis 1 if invalid
- **Data Fetching**: Uses `useBibleChapter(bookId, chapterNumber)` hook from the existing API layer
- **Reading Position Persistence**: Calls `useSaveLastRead()` mutation on mount with guest user ID, book ID, and chapter number
- **Loading States**: Shows `SkeletonLoader` while `isLoading === true`, displays error message if chapter not found
- **Fixed Header**: Implements 56px black header with book/chapter title and three icon buttons (navigation, read mode, menu) - all showing "Coming Soon" alerts as placeholders
- **Scrollable Content**: Wraps `ChapterReader` in a ScrollView with proper padding from design tokens

**Rationale**: This component serves as the entry point for the main reading experience. Using Expo Router's file-based routing provides clean URLs and supports deep linking. The fixed header pattern with scrollable content is a common mobile pattern that keeps navigation accessible while maximizing reading space.

### ChapterReader Component
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/components/bible/ChapterReader.tsx`

The ChapterReader component handles the presentation of Bible text and explanation content. Key features include:

- **Typography Hierarchy**: Renders chapter title (32px bold), section subtitles (20px semibold), verse range captions (12px gray), and verse text (18px regular) using design tokens
- **Verse Number Styling**: Displays verse numbers as superscript-style text (12px bold, positioned with -4px margin-top) for visual distinction
- **Section Grouping**: Iterates over chapter sections, rendering subtitle and verse range for each
- **Markdown Support**: Integrates `react-native-markdown-display` for explanation content with custom styles matching the design system (headings, paragraphs, bold, italic, lists, code blocks, blockquotes)
- **Conditional Rendering**: Only renders explanation section when `explanation` prop is provided

**Rationale**: Separating the content rendering logic into its own component follows React best practices for single responsibility and reusability. Using design tokens ensures consistency and makes theme changes easy. The markdown support is essential for rich explanation content with formatting.

### Test Implementation
**Locations:**
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/app/bible/chapterNumber.test.tsx`
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/components/bible/ChapterReader.test.tsx`

Implemented 12 focused tests total (6 for screen, 6 for component):

**Chapter Screen Tests:**
1. Renders screen with valid params (verifies header and content)
2. Shows skeleton loader while loading (tests loading state)
3. Displays chapter content after loading (verifies data display)
4. Calls save reading position on mount (verifies API integration)
5. Redirects to Genesis 1 when bookId invalid (tests error handling)
6. Displays header with book and chapter title (tests header rendering)

**ChapterReader Tests:**
1. Renders chapter title with correct styling (tests title display)
2. Renders section subtitles when present (tests subtitle rendering)
3. Renders verse range captions for each section (tests verse range display)
4. Renders verse text with superscript verse numbers (tests verse formatting)
5. Renders explanation content in markdown format (tests markdown integration)
6. Renders all sections in order (tests section iteration)

**Rationale**: These tests focus on core user flows and critical functionality as specified in the testing standards. They verify the main user journey (loading → display → reading) without exhaustively testing edge cases, which aligns with the "focused tests" requirement.

## Database Changes
No database changes were made. This task uses existing API endpoints and data structures.

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies Added
- `react-native-markdown-display` (version 7.0.2) - Used for rendering markdown-formatted explanation content with custom styling

**Purpose**: This library provides React Native-compatible markdown rendering, which is essential for displaying the AI-generated Bible explanations with proper formatting (headings, bold text, lists, etc.).

### Configuration Changes
None - all configuration was already in place from previous task groups.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/app/bible/chapterNumber.test.tsx` - Tests for chapter screen routing and layout
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/components/bible/ChapterReader.test.tsx` - Tests for chapter content rendering

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (12 tests covering core functionality)
- Integration tests: ✅ Partial (tests verify component integration with API hooks via mocks)
- Edge cases covered: Basic error handling (invalid bookId), loading states, redirect logic

### Manual Testing Performed
**Test Command Run:**
```bash
npm test -- "(chapterNumber|ChapterReader)"
```

**Results:**
- All 12 tests passed successfully
- No console warnings or errors
- Total execution time: 1.455s

**Additional Verification:**
- TypeScript compilation: `bun tsc --noEmit` - No errors
- Linting: `bun run lint:fix` - All issues auto-fixed, no remaining errors
- Component rendering verified via test snapshots

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Frontend Components Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Single Responsibility**: `ChapterScreen` handles routing and layout; `ChapterReader` handles content rendering; `ChapterHeader` (sub-component) handles header UI
- **Reusability**: `ChapterReader` accepts generic `chapter` and `activeTab` props, making it reusable for any book/chapter combination
- **Clear Interface**: Both components have well-defined TypeScript interfaces with JSDoc comments documenting prop purposes
- **Minimal Props**: `ChapterReader` has only 3 props (chapter, activeTab, explanation), `ChapterHeader` has 5 focused callback props
- **Documentation**: All components include JSDoc comments with descriptions, spec references, and @see tags

**Deviations**: None.

### Frontend Accessibility Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Semantic Structure**: Uses `accessibilityRole="header"` for chapter titles and section subtitles, `accessibilityRole="button"` for icon buttons
- **Descriptive Labels**: All icon buttons have `accessibilityLabel` props ("Open navigation", "Change read mode", "Open menu")
- **Screen Reader Support**: Verse numbers include `accessibilityLabel="Verse {number}"` for VoiceOver/TalkBack compatibility
- **Color Contrast**: Uses design tokens with documented WCAG AA compliance (black on white for text = 21:1 ratio)
- **Logical Heading Structure**: Chapter title → Section subtitles → Verse text maintains proper hierarchy

**Deviations**: Did not use `accessibilityLevel` prop (not available in React Native), relied on `accessibilityRole` instead which is the correct approach for React Native.

### Frontend CSS/Styling Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- All styling uses React Native's `StyleSheet.create()` for performance optimization
- Typography values sourced from design tokens (`fontSizes`, `fontWeights`, `lineHeights`, `letterSpacing`)
- Color values use design tokens (`colors.gold`, `colors.gray900`, etc.)
- Spacing uses design tokens (`spacing.lg`, `spacing.xxl`, etc.)
- No inline styles used - all styles defined in `StyleSheet.create()` objects

**Deviations**: None.

### Frontend Responsive Design Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Layout uses React Native's flexbox (flex: 1, flexDirection: 'row/column')
- ScrollView enables vertical scrolling for content of any length
- Fixed header pattern (56px) works across all screen sizes
- Design tokens provide consistent spacing that scales appropriately
- Typography sizes defined in absolute pixels will respond to OS font size settings via React Native's default scaling

**Deviations**: None - React Native handles responsive scaling natively.

### Global Coding Style Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Consistent naming: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for components, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants (though none used)
- Clear, descriptive names: `ChapterReader`, `saveLastRead`, `validBookId`, `headerActions`
- JSDoc comments on all exported components and complex functions
- File organization: imports grouped (React, React Native, third-party, local), component definition, sub-components, styles
- Code formatted with Biome.js (2 spaces, single quotes, semicolons, 100 line width)

**Deviations**: None.

### Global Error Handling Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Validates route parameters and redirects invalid bookId to Genesis 1 (graceful degradation)
- Shows error state UI when chapter data unavailable (instead of crashing)
- Reading position save failures are silent (no user-facing error) as specified
- Uses optional chaining for safety (e.g., `chapter?.bookName`)
- TypeScript strict mode ensures type safety at compile time

**Deviations**: None.

### Test Writing Standards
**File Reference:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/agent-os/standards/testing/test-writing.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Minimal Tests During Development**: Wrote only 12 focused tests covering core user flows, not exhaustive coverage
- **Test Only Core User Flows**: Tests verify main reading journey (load → display → interact), skip secondary workflows
- **Defer Edge Case Testing**: Focused on happy path and one critical error case (invalid bookId), skipped comprehensive error testing
- **Test Behavior**: Tests verify what components render (titles, subtitles, verses) not implementation details (state management)
- **Clear Test Names**: Descriptive names like "renders chapter title with correct styling" and "shows skeleton loader while loading chapter"
- **Mock External Dependencies**: All API calls mocked via Jest, no actual network requests

**Deviations**: None.

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
- **React Query Hooks**:
  - `useBibleChapter(bookId, chapterNumber)` - Fetches chapter data from `/bible/book/{bookId}/{chapterNumber}`
  - `useSaveLastRead()` - Posts reading position to `/bible/book/chapter/save-last-read`
  - `useActiveTab()` - Custom hook managing AsyncStorage for tab persistence

### Internal Dependencies
- **Design Tokens**: `@/constants/bible-design-tokens` for colors, typography, spacing, header specs
- **Type Definitions**: `@/types/bible` for `ChapterContent`, `ContentTabType`, `ExplanationContent`
- **Existing Components**: `@/components/bible/SkeletonLoader` for loading states
- **Existing Hooks**: `@/hooks/bible/use-active-tab` for tab state management
- **Icons**: `@expo/vector-icons` for Ionicons (book-outline, moon-outline, menu)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified during implementation or testing.

### Limitations

1. **Placeholder Navigation**
   - Description: Header icons show "Coming Soon" alerts instead of functional navigation
   - Reason: Navigation modal, read mode toggle, and hamburger menu are separate task groups (not yet implemented)
   - Future Consideration: Will be replaced with actual navigation handlers in Task Groups 5, 6, 7

2. **Guest User Only**
   - Description: Reading position saves with hardcoded `user_id: 'guest'`
   - Reason: Authentication system not implemented yet (out of scope for current spec)
   - Future Consideration: Will be replaced with actual user ID from auth context when authentication is added

3. **No Explanation Content Display**
   - Description: ChapterReader renders Bible text but explanation prop is not yet passed from screen
   - Reason: Content tabs (Summary/By Line/Detailed) will be implemented in next task group
   - Future Consideration: Task Group 5 will add tab switching UI and pass appropriate explanation content

4. **No Chapter Navigation**
   - Description: Cannot navigate to previous/next chapters yet
   - Reason: Floating action buttons and swipe gestures are separate task groups
   - Future Consideration: Will be added in Task Group 6

## Performance Considerations

**Loading Performance:**
- Skeleton loader provides immediate visual feedback while data fetches
- React Query handles caching, reducing redundant API calls
- Component memoization not needed yet (simple rendering, no complex calculations)

**Rendering Performance:**
- StyleSheet.create() compiles styles once for performance
- ScrollView uses native scrolling for smooth 60fps experience
- Markdown rendering happens synchronously but content size is manageable (single chapter)

**Future Optimizations:**
- Consider virtualization (FlatList) if verse count becomes very large (some chapters have 150+ verses)
- Add prefetching for next/previous chapters (hooks already available: `usePrefetchNextChapter`, `usePrefetchPreviousChapter`)

## Security Considerations

**Input Validation:**
- Route parameters (bookId, chapterNumber) are validated and constrained to valid ranges
- Invalid inputs redirect to safe default (Genesis 1) instead of crashing or exposing errors

**Markdown Rendering:**
- Using trusted library (react-native-markdown-display) for XSS protection
- Markdown content comes from backend API (assumed to be sanitized server-side)
- No user-generated content rendered in markdown

**Data Privacy:**
- Reading position stored locally (AsyncStorage) and sent to backend
- Uses guest user ID (no personal data) until authentication added

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

**Blocked Tasks:**
- Task Group 5 (Content Tabs) - Depends on this screen's layout and ChapterReader component
- Task Group 6 (Chapter Navigation) - Depends on this screen's structure for adding FABs and swipe gestures
- Task Group 7 (Navigation Modal) - Will integrate with this screen's header navigation button
- Task Group 8 (Hamburger Menu) - Will integrate with this screen's header menu button

**Provided Interfaces:**
- `ChapterScreen` component with stable URL structure (`/bible/[bookId]/[chapterNumber]`)
- `ChapterReader` component accepting chapter data and activeTab prop
- Test patterns for route-based components and content renderers

## Notes

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Smooth integration with existing API layer - no additional API code needed
- Clean separation of concerns: routing (screen) vs rendering (reader) vs layout (header)
- Accessibility-first approach with proper roles and labels from the start
- Design tokens provide consistency and make future theming trivial

**Development Experience:**
- TypeScript caught several type mismatches during development (ChapterSection shape, router.replace type)
- Test-driven approach helped identify missing testIDs and accessibility labels early
- Biome.js auto-formatting kept code style consistent throughout

**Next Steps:**
- Task Group 5 will add the content tabs UI above the ScrollView
- Task Group 6 will add floating prev/next buttons and swipe gesture handling
- Current implementation provides solid foundation for these enhancements
