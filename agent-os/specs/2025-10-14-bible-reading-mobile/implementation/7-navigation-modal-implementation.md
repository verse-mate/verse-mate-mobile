# Task 7: Navigation Modal (Book/Chapter Selection)

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #7 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-14-bible-reading-mobile/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** UI Designer (Claude Code Agent)
**Date:** October 14, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement a bottom-sheet navigation modal for Bible book and chapter selection. The modal features testament tabs, recent books tracking, book filtering, and a 5-column chapter grid with swipe-to-dismiss gesture support.

## Implementation Summary

This task implements a comprehensive navigation modal that serves as the primary interface for users to navigate between Bible books and chapters. The implementation follows iOS-style bottom sheet patterns with smooth animations and intuitive gestures.

Key highlights include:
1. **useRecentBooks hook** - Tracks the last 5 books accessed with AsyncStorage persistence and 30-day expiry
2. **BibleNavigationModal component** - Full-featured bottom sheet with testament tabs, book list, chapter grid, and filter functionality
3. **Gesture support** - Swipe-to-dismiss with spring animations
4. **Recent books integration** - Shows recently accessed books at the top with clock icons
5. **Responsive chapter grid** - 5-column layout that adapts to different screen sizes

The implementation prioritizes user experience with haptic feedback, real-time filtering, and smooth transitions between states.

## Key Implementation Details

### useRecentBooks Hook
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/hooks/bible/use-recent-books.ts`

Implements persistent recent books tracking with the following features:
- Stores max 5 recent books in AsyncStorage with timestamps
- Automatically filters out entries older than 30 days on load
- Moves existing books to top when accessed again
- Type-safe with full TypeScript support
- Error handling with graceful degradation

**Key Functions:**
- `addRecentBook(bookId)` - Adds or updates a book in the recent list
- `clearRecentBooks()` - Clears all recent books (for testing/user action)
- Returns `{ recentBooks, addRecentBook, clearRecentBooks, isLoading, error }`

**Rationale:** AsyncStorage provides reliable local persistence across app restarts. The 30-day expiry prevents the list from becoming stale, and limiting to 5 books keeps the UI clean and focused on truly recent activity.

### BibleNavigationModal Component
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/components/bible/BibleNavigationModal.tsx`

A full-featured bottom sheet modal with multiple interaction modes:

**Props Interface:**
```typescript
interface BibleNavigationModalProps {
  visible: boolean;
  currentBookId: number;
  currentChapter: number;
  onClose: () => void;
  onSelectChapter: (bookId: number, chapter: number) => void;
}
```

**Key Features:**
1. **Testament Tabs** - Switch between Old and New Testament with gold highlighting for active tab
2. **Recent Books** - Shows up to 5 recently accessed books at top with clock icon
3. **Book List** - Full scrollable list of all books with selected state (gold background)
4. **Filter Input** - Real-time case-insensitive search with clear button
5. **Chapter Grid** - 5-column responsive grid (17.6% width per cell) with current chapter highlighted
6. **Breadcrumb** - Shows current location as "Testament, Book, Chapter" in gold
7. **Swipe Gesture** - Swipe down > 100px to dismiss with spring animation
8. **Backdrop** - Semi-transparent black (50% opacity) that fades during swipe

**Animation Details:**
- Modal entrance: Spring animation (damping: 15, stiffness: 150)
- Swipe gesture: Dynamic transform based on translateY
- Backdrop fade: Opacity transitions during swipe (1.0 → 0 based on distance)

**Rationale:** The bottom sheet pattern is familiar to iOS users and provides a natural, non-intrusive way to access navigation without leaving the current reading context. The 5-column grid balances readability with efficiency, allowing users to see many chapters at once without scrolling.

### Testament Tab Switching
**Location:** Within BibleNavigationModal component

Implements simple text-based tabs that switch between Old and New Testament:
- Active tab: gold text (#b09a6d), medium weight
- Inactive tab: black text, regular weight
- Clears filter input on switch to avoid confusion
- Clears selected book to show full list
- Haptic feedback (light) on tap

**Rationale:** Text-based tabs are clearer than icons for this use case since the distinction between testaments is conceptual, not visual. The gold color ties into the app's branding and provides clear visual feedback.

### Recent Books Display
**Location:** Within BibleNavigationModal book list rendering

Recent books appear at the top of the book list before regular books:
- Clock icon (Ionicons "time-outline") indicates recency
- Filtered by current testament
- Merged with full book list to avoid duplication
- Respects filter input (shows only recent books that match)

**Rationale:** Placing recent books at the top reduces navigation time for users studying specific books. The clock icon provides a clear visual cue without requiring text labels.

### Filter/Search Implementation
**Location:** Within BibleNavigationModal component

Real-time filter with the following behavior:
- TextInput with placeholder "Filter books..."
- Light gray background (#f5f5f5) for subtle contrast
- Case-insensitive search using `toLowerCase()`
- Clear button (X icon) appears when filter has text
- Filters both recent and regular books
- Switches from chapter grid to book list when filter is active

**Rationale:** Real-time filtering provides immediate feedback and helps users find books quickly without requiring a separate search UI. The clear button provides an easy way to reset without selecting all text.

### Chapter Grid Layout
**Location:** Within BibleNavigationModal chapter grid rendering

5-column responsive grid with the following styling:
- Width: 17.6% per cell (accounts for gaps)
- Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square buttons)
- Gap: 12px (spacing.md)
- Current chapter: gold background (#b09a6d), dark text
- Other chapters: white background, black text
- Border: 1px gray200
- Border radius: 8px

**Calculations:**
```
5 columns with 12px gaps:
- Total gap width: 4 gaps × 12px = 48px
- Available width per column: (100% - gaps) / 5
- Simplified to 17.6% with CSS gap property
```

**Rationale:** 5 columns strikes the right balance between showing many chapters (good for books like Psalms with 150 chapters) and maintaining tap target size (minimum 44×44px for accessibility). The square aspect ratio creates a clean, grid-like appearance.

### Breadcrumb Navigation
**Location:** Within BibleNavigationModal header

Shows current location in breadcrumb format:
- Format: "Testament, Book, Chapter" (e.g., "Old Testament, Genesis, 1")
- Gold text color (#b09a6d)
- Chevron-down icon indicates modal expandability
- Updates automatically as user navigates

**Rationale:** The breadcrumb provides context for where the user is in the Bible structure and reinforces the modal's purpose as a navigation tool. The chevron-down is a familiar iOS pattern for expandable sheets.

### Swipe-to-Dismiss Gesture
**Location:** Within BibleNavigationModal component

Implements intuitive swipe gesture using react-native-reanimated and react-native-gesture-handler:
- Pan gesture tracks vertical translation (translateY)
- Only allows downward swipe (positive translateY)
- Threshold: 100px to trigger dismiss
- Snaps back if threshold not met
- Backdrop opacity fades proportionally to swipe distance

**Animation Details:**
```typescript
// During swipe
translateY.value = e.translationY; // Direct mapping
backdropOpacity.value = Math.max(0, 1 - e.translationY / 300);

// On release (threshold not met)
translateY.value = withSpring(0, springConfig);
backdropOpacity.value = withTiming(1, { duration: 200 });

// On release (threshold met)
runOnJS(onClose)(); // Trigger close callback
```

**Rationale:** Swipe-to-dismiss is a natural gesture for bottom sheets and provides an alternative to tapping the backdrop or close button. The spring animation creates a satisfying, physical feel when snapping back.

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/hooks/bible/use-recent-books.test.ts` - Hook tests (5 tests)
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/components/bible/BibleNavigationModal.test.tsx` - Component tests (5 tests)

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (10 tests total, all passing)
- Integration tests: ⚠️ Partial (component tests mock dependencies)
- Edge cases covered:
  - Recent books expiry (> 30 days)
  - Moving existing books to top
  - Filtering with empty results
  - Chapter selection at boundaries
  - Testament switching with selected book

### Manual Testing Performed
Tests run with Jest and React Native Testing Library:
```bash
npm test -- use-recent-books.test.ts --no-coverage
# PASS: 5/5 tests passing

npm test -- BibleNavigationModal.test.tsx --no-coverage
# PASS: 5/5 tests passing
```

**Test Results:**
- useRecentBooks: All 5 tests pass (load, filter expired, add, move to top, default empty)
- BibleNavigationModal: All 5 tests pass (render, chapter grid, chapter selection, filter input, book filtering)

**Note:** Visual testing should be performed on iOS simulator to verify:
- Modal animations (spring bounce, swipe smoothness)
- Chapter grid layout (5 columns, proper gaps)
- Recent books display (clock icons visible)
- Haptic feedback responsiveness

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Frontend - Accessibility Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- All interactive elements have `accessibilityRole` and `accessibilityLabel` attributes
- Chapter buttons labeled as "Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", etc. for screen readers
- Testament tabs have `accessibilityState={{selected}}` to indicate active state
- Filter input has clear `accessibilityLabel="Filter books"`
- Tap targets meet minimum 44×44px size (chapter buttons are square with adequate size)
- Color is not the sole indicator - gold backgrounds are paired with checkmarks/text changes

**Deviations:** None - full compliance with accessibility standards

### Frontend - Components Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Single Responsibility**: BibleNavigationModal handles navigation, useRecentBooks handles recency tracking - clear separation
- **Reusability**: Modal accepts props for flexibility, can be used from any screen
- **Composability**: Modal combines smaller pieces (testament tabs, book list, chapter grid)
- **Clear Interface**: Props are explicitly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- **Minimal Props**: Only 5 props (visible, current state, callbacks)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive JSDoc comments explain component purpose and usage

**Deviations:** None - follows all component best practices

### Frontend - CSS Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Uses centralized design tokens from `/constants/bible-design-tokens.ts`
- Consistent methodology with StyleSheet.create() pattern
- No framework overrides - works with React Native patterns
- Performance optimized with static styles (no inline style objects in render)

**Deviations:** None - adheres to CSS/styling standards

### Frontend - Responsive Design
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/responsive.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Mobile-first approach (designed for phone screens)
- Percentage-based widths for chapter grid (17.6% per column)
- Touch-friendly tap targets (56px for chapter buttons, well above 44px minimum)
- Modal adapts to screen height (80% of viewport)
- Readable typography at all sizes (minimum 12px for captions)

**Deviations:** None - fully responsive design

### Global - Coding Style
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Consistent naming: camelCase for functions, PascalCase for components
- Automated formatting with Biome.js (2 spaces, semicolons, single quotes)
- Meaningful names: `useRecentBooks`, `handleChapterSelect`, `renderBookList`
- Small, focused functions (rendering methods under 50 lines)
- No dead code or commented-out blocks
- DRY principle: reused book filtering logic, common styles

**Deviations:** None - follows coding style guide

### Global - Commenting
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/commenting.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- JSDoc comments for all exported functions and components
- Inline comments for complex logic (expiry calculation, filter logic)
- Clear parameter descriptions in JSDoc
- Examples in JSDoc for hooks

**Deviations:** None - well-documented code

### Global - Error Handling
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/error-handling.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Try-catch blocks in async operations (AsyncStorage calls)
- Graceful degradation: errors logged but don't crash app
- Error state exposed in hook return values
- Invalid bookId validation in addRecentBook()

**Deviations:** None - proper error handling throughout

### Global - Validation
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/validation.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- Input validation for bookId (must be 1-66)
- Type validation using TypeScript guards (`isContentTabType`)
- Runtime validation for filter input (case-insensitive)
- Props validation through TypeScript interfaces

**Deviations:** None - comprehensive validation

## Integration Points

### APIs/Endpoints
**React Query Hooks (Client-side):**
- `useBibleTestaments()` - Fetches all 66 books with metadata (lightweight)
  - Returns: `{ data: BookMetadata[], isLoading, error }`
  - Used for populating book list

### Internal Dependencies
- **useRecentBooks hook** - Provides recent books data to modal
- **useBibleTestaments hook** - Provides full book list from API layer
- **Design tokens** - Colors, spacing, typography from `/constants/bible-design-tokens.ts`
- **Type definitions** - Testament, BookMetadata, RecentBook from `/types/bible.ts`
- **Expo Haptics** - Provides haptic feedback on interactions
- **React Native Reanimated** - Powers smooth animations
- **React Native Gesture Handler** - Handles swipe gestures
- **Ionicons** - Provides icons (clock, checkmark, chevron, close)

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified during implementation and testing.

### Limitations

1. **No Book Preloading**
   - Description: Modal doesn't preload book metadata - fetched on first open
   - Impact: Slight delay on first modal open if data not cached
   - Reason: API layer handles caching, modal stays lightweight
   - Future Consideration: Could add prefetch on app launch

2. **No Keyboard Dismissal**
   - Description: Filter input doesn't dismiss keyboard when scrolling book list
   - Impact: Minor UX issue - keyboard covers content
   - Reason: React Native default behavior, would require additional gesture handling
   - Future Consideration: Add keyboard-aware scroll view

3. **No Testament Persistence**
   - Description: Modal resets to current book's testament each time it opens
   - Impact: Users must switch testaments if browsing
   - Reason: Keeps modal focused on current context
   - Future Consideration: Could persist testament selection in AsyncStorage

## Performance Considerations

- **Memoization**: Uses `useMemo` for expensive filtering operations (testament books, recent books)
- **Lazy Rendering**: Chapter grid only renders when book is selected
- **Optimized Lists**: Book list uses proper keys for efficient reconciliation
- **Animation Performance**: Reanimated runs animations on UI thread (60fps)
- **AsyncStorage**: Batches recent books writes to avoid excessive I/O

**Potential Optimizations:**
- Could virtualize book list for very large testaments (not needed with current 66 books)
- Could add debouncing to filter input (current real-time works well)

## Security Considerations

- **Input Sanitization**: bookId validated before AsyncStorage writes
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript prevents invalid data types
- **No User Data**: Recent books stored locally, no personal identifiable information
- **XSS Prevention**: No innerHTML or dangerouslySetInnerHTML used

## Dependencies for Other Tasks

This implementation provides the navigation modal that should be integrated into the chapter screen (Task 4). The modal will need to be wired up with:
- State management for modal visibility
- Navigation icon in header to open modal
- onSelectChapter callback to handle chapter navigation
- Recent books tracking on chapter navigation

## Notes

**Design Decisions:**
1. **Why 5 columns for chapter grid?** - Balances showing many chapters with maintaining tap target size. 4 columns feels too spacious, 6 columns creates targets too small for comfortable tapping.

2. **Why max 5 recent books?** - Keeps the UI clean and focused. More than 5 starts to feel like a complete list rather than "recent" items. Also fits well on most phone screens without scrolling.

3. **Why 30-day expiry?** - Balances showing truly recent books with not expiring too aggressively. Users who take breaks from reading won't lose their history immediately, but stale entries eventually clear out.

4. **Why text tabs instead of icons?** - Testament names are short and clear. Icons would require additional cognitive load (what does this icon mean?) and localization complexity.

5. **Why swipe-to-dismiss instead of just backdrop tap?** - Provides two dismiss methods for user preference. Swipe feels more natural on mobile and aligns with iOS patterns.

**Implementation Patterns to Reuse:**
- The useRecentBooks pattern can be adapted for other "recent items" features (e.g., recent searches, recent notes)
- The bottom sheet modal pattern can be reused for other full-screen selection UIs
- The filter input pattern works well for any searchable list

**Testing Notes:**
- Tests focus on functionality rather than visual styling (per spec instructions)
- Component tests use mocked dependencies to isolate behavior
- Hook tests verify AsyncStorage integration without requiring actual storage
- Manual testing on simulator still recommended for animations and gestures
