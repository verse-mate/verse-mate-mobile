# Task 3: Skeleton Loader Component

## Overview
**Task Reference:** Task #3 from `agent-os/specs/2025-10-14-bible-reading-mobile/tasks.md`
**Implemented By:** UI Designer (Claude Code)
**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Task Description
Implement a loading skeleton component with shimmer animation for Bible reading content. This component provides visual feedback during content loading, maintaining layout stability and user engagement while chapter data is being fetched.

## Implementation Summary
The SkeletonLoader component was implemented using react-native-reanimated (v4.1.1) for smooth 60fps animations. The component renders a placeholder layout that matches the structure of Bible chapter content: a title, subtitle, and three paragraph blocks. The shimmer effect is achieved through an opacity pulse animation that cycles continuously from 1.0 to 0.5 and back, creating a subtle loading indication.

The implementation follows React Native best practices with TypeScript strict typing, uses design tokens from the established design system, and includes comprehensive test coverage to ensure reliability. Storybook stories were created to demonstrate different viewport sizes and use cases.

## Key Implementation Details

### Component Architecture
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/components/bible/SkeletonLoader.tsx`

The SkeletonLoader is a functional React component that uses hooks for animation management. It consists of:
- Container view with padding (20px) for content spacing
- Title skeleton: 60% width, 32px height (represents chapter title)
- Subtitle skeleton: 40% width, 20px height (represents section heading)
- Three paragraph skeletons: 100%, 100%, 80% width, 16px height (represents verse content)

Each skeleton element uses `Animated.View` from react-native-reanimated with a shared animated style that controls opacity for the shimmer effect.

**Rationale:** This structure matches the typical Bible chapter layout seen in the spec mockups, providing accurate content shape during loading. The 60/40/100/100/80 width pattern creates visual variety that mimics actual text content.

### Shimmer Animation Implementation
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/components/bible/SkeletonLoader.tsx` (lines 28-38)

The shimmer animation uses react-native-reanimated's declarative API:
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  opacity.value = withRepeat(
    withSequence(
      withTiming(0.5, { duration: 750 }),
      withTiming(1, { duration: 750 })
    ),
    -1, // infinite
    false
  );
}, [opacity]);
```

This creates a continuous pulse animation:
- Starts at opacity 1.0 (fully visible)
- Animates to 0.5 over 750ms (fade out)
- Animates back to 1.0 over 750ms (fade in)
- Repeats infinitely with no reverse flag

**Rationale:** The 1500ms cycle (750ms × 2) provides a subtle, non-distracting shimmer that runs at 60fps on the UI thread (not JS thread) thanks to reanimated. The opacity range of 0.5-1.0 keeps the skeleton visible while creating noticeable movement.

### Design Token Integration
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/components/bible/SkeletonLoader.tsx` (StyleSheet section)

All styling values are derived from the design tokens established in Task Group 1:
- Background color: `skeletonSpecs.backgroundColor` (#e0e0e0, gray100)
- Border radius: `skeletonSpecs.borderRadius` (4px)
- Heights: `skeletonSpecs.titleHeight` (32px), `subtitleHeight` (20px), `paragraphHeight` (16px)

**Rationale:** Using design tokens ensures visual consistency with the rest of the application and makes future theme updates easier. The gray100 background provides sufficient contrast against white without being visually jarring.

### Test Coverage
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/components/bible/SkeletonLoader.test.tsx`

Three focused tests were implemented:
1. **Renders without crashing** - Verifies basic component mounting and structure
2. **Starts shimmer animation on mount** - Ensures animation initialization doesn't throw errors
3. **Renders all skeleton elements** - Confirms all five skeleton blocks are present with correct testIDs

**Rationale:** Tests focus on critical functionality (rendering and animation start) without testing implementation details like exact animation timing. This follows the user requirement for "focused tests" rather than exhaustive coverage.

### Storybook Integration
**Location:** `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/components/bible/SkeletonLoader.stories.tsx`

Four stories were created:
- **Default** - Standard skeleton view
- **MobileView** - Constrained to 375px width (iPhone SE size)
- **TabletView** - Constrained to 768px width (iPad size)
- **MultipleSkeletons** - Shows three stacked skeletons with spacing

**Rationale:** These stories demonstrate responsive behavior across different device sizes and show how the component looks when multiple instances are used together (common during initial app load).

## Database Changes
N/A - This is a UI-only component with no backend or database dependencies.

## Dependencies
No new dependencies were added. The implementation uses existing dependencies:
- `react-native-reanimated` (v4.1.1) - Already installed, used for 60fps animations
- `react-native` - Core framework
- `@storybook/react-native` - Already configured for component stories
- `@testing-library/react-native` - Already configured for component testing

## Testing

### Test Files Created/Updated
- `/Users/augustochaves/Work/verse-mate/verse-mate-mobile/__tests__/components/bible/SkeletonLoader.test.tsx` - 3 tests covering component rendering and animation

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ✅ Complete (3/3 tests passing)
- Integration tests: N/A (standalone component)
- Edge cases covered: Component mounting, animation initialization, element structure

### Manual Testing Performed
1. **Test Execution**: Ran `npm test -- SkeletonLoader.test` - All 3 tests passed in 1.143s
2. **TypeScript Compilation**: Ran `bun tsc --noEmit` - No errors
3. **Linting**: Ran `bun run lint` - No errors in SkeletonLoader files (warnings only in pre-existing test setup files)
4. **Visual Verification**: Confirmed component structure matches spec requirements (60/40/100/100/80 width pattern, gray100 background)

Note: iOS simulator testing was not performed in this implementation session but is recommended before final release to verify 60fps performance on physical devices.

## User Standards & Preferences Compliance

### Frontend Components Best Practices
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/components.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
The SkeletonLoader follows all component best practices:
- **Single Responsibility**: Component has one clear purpose - showing loading state with shimmer animation
- **Reusability**: No props required for basic use, making it easy to drop into any loading scenario
- **Clear Interface**: Simple function component with no required configuration
- **Minimal Props**: Zero props required (maximum reusability)
- **Documentation**: JSDoc comments explain purpose, features, and reference spec lines

**Deviations:** None

### CSS Best Practices
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/css.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Design System**: All styling values come from `bible-design-tokens.ts` constants
- **Consistent Methodology**: Uses React Native StyleSheet API consistently
- **Minimize Custom CSS**: Leverages design tokens instead of hardcoded values
- **No Framework Overrides**: Works within React Native's style system without hacks

**Deviations:** None

### Accessibility Best Practices
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/frontend/accessibility.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- **Semantic Structure**: Uses `View` components with proper hierarchy
- **Screen Reader Support**: Includes `testID` attributes for accessibility testing tools
- **Color Contrast**: Gray100 (#e0e0e0) on white provides sufficient contrast for skeleton elements
- **Focus Management**: N/A for loading skeleton (non-interactive)

**Deviations:** None - Loading skeletons are decorative and don't require ARIA labels

### Global Coding Standards
**File Reference:** `agent-os/standards/global/coding-style.md`

**How Implementation Complies:**
- TypeScript strict mode enabled, all code properly typed
- No use of `any` type
- Clear, descriptive naming (SkeletonLoader, animatedStyle, opacity)
- Proper JSDoc comments for component and complex logic

**Deviations:** None

## Integration Points
N/A - This is a standalone UI component with no external integrations. It will be imported by future components that need loading states (ChapterReader, BibleNavigationModal, etc.).

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Issues
None identified in current implementation.

### Limitations
1. **No Customization Props**
   - Description: Component has fixed skeleton structure (1 title, 1 subtitle, 3 paragraphs)
   - Reason: Spec requires specific layout for Bible chapter loading
   - Future Consideration: Could add optional props for customizable skeleton patterns if needed by other features

2. **Fixed Animation Duration**
   - Description: 1500ms shimmer cycle is hardcoded
   - Reason: Spec specifies exact timing for consistent UX
   - Future Consideration: Could make animation duration configurable if different speeds are needed

## Performance Considerations
The component uses react-native-reanimated which runs animations on the UI thread (not JavaScript thread), ensuring smooth 60fps performance even during heavy JavaScript work. The animation uses only opacity changes, which are GPU-accelerated on all platforms.

Memory usage is minimal - the component renders only 5 simple View elements with a single shared animation value.

## Security Considerations
N/A - This is a purely visual component with no data handling, network requests, or user input.

## Dependencies for Other Tasks
The following task groups depend on SkeletonLoader being complete:
- Task Group 4: Chapter Reading Interface - Uses SkeletonLoader during chapter content loading
- Task Group 5: Bible Navigation Modal - Uses SkeletonLoader during book list loading
- Task Group 6: Progress Bar Component - May use SkeletonLoader pattern for its own loading state

## Notes
- The shimmer animation was tested to ensure it doesn't cause console warnings about Animated API usage
- The component is ready for use in any loading scenario throughout the Bible reading interface
- Storybook stories provide visual documentation for designers and developers
- All acceptance criteria from the task definition were met
