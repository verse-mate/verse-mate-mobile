## Execution Order Summary

**Sequential phases (no parallelization):**
1. Phase 1 (Task Group 1): Bundle Identifier Migration - CRITICAL FIRST STEP
2. Phase 2 (Task Groups 2-4): EAS Build Configuration
3. Phase 3 (Task Groups 5-6): App Store Registration (requires completed bundle identifier)
4. Phase 4 (Task Groups 7-8): Credential Creation (requires app store registrations)
5. Phase 5 (Task Groups 9-11): GitHub Integration (requires credentials)
6. Phase 6 (Task Group 12): First Preview Build & Testing (requires workflows)
7. Phase 7 (Task Groups 13-14): Production Build Setup (requires successful preview builds)
8. Phase 8 (Task Groups 15-17): Production Release & Documentation (final validation)

**Key dependency chains:**
- Bundle identifier MUST be updated before app store registration
- App store registration MUST be complete before credential creation
- Credentials MUST exist before GitHub Secrets configuration
- GitHub Secrets MUST be configured before workflow execution
- Preview builds should succeed before attempting production builds

**Estimated timeline:**
- Day 1: Phase 1 + Phase 2 (Task Groups 1-4)
- Day 2-3: Phase 3 (Task Groups 5-6)
- Day 3-4: Phase 4 (Task Groups 7-8)
- Day 4-5: Phase 5 (Task Groups 9-11)
- Day 5-6: Phase 6 (Task Group 12)
- Day 6-7: Phase 7 (Task Groups 13-14)
- Day 7-8+: Phase 8 (Task Groups 15-17)

**Total task groups:** 17
**Total sub-tasks:** 150+
**Critical path:** Bundle ID → EAS → App Stores → Credentials → GitHub → Builds → Production

## Risk Mitigation Reminders

**High Priority Risks to Monitor:**
1. Bundle identifier change may affect deep linking - test thoroughly (Task 1.5)
2. First app store submission may be rejected - be prepared to iterate (Tasks 15.3, 15.5)
3. Free tier build quota may be exhausted - monitor usage (Task 17.4)

**Medium Priority Risks:**
4. Credentials expire yearly - set renewal reminders (Task 7.4)
5. GitHub Actions may fail - document CLI fallback (Task 16.5, 16.7)
6. Environment variables may be misconfigured - test each profile (Tasks 12.9, 13.8)

Spec reference for all risks: spec.md lines 713-788
