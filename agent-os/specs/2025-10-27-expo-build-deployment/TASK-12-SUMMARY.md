# Task Group 12 Implementation Summary

## Status: Partially Complete (20%)

Task Group 12 was initiated to simulate the CI/CD flow locally by running the deployment scripts. The execution identified a critical prerequisite that must be completed interactively before automated builds can proceed.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Script Execution Attempted
- ✅ Ran `.deployment/build-preview.sh` to trigger iOS preview build
- ✅ Identified iOS credential configuration blocker
- ✅ Documented root cause and solution path

### 2. Comprehensive Documentation Created

**File: `CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md`**
- Complete step-by-step guide for iOS credential setup
- Two options provided: interactive build OR credential configuration
- Troubleshooting section for common issues
- Security considerations and best practices
- Verification checklist

**File: `task-12-execution-log.md`**
- Detailed execution log of what was attempted
- Root cause analysis of the credential blocker
- Clear explanation of EAS credential management
- Solution path forward with two options
- Time estimates and recommendations

### 3. Tasks File Updated
- ✅ Added task 12.0.1 for credential prerequisite
- ✅ Marked completed sub-tasks with [x]
- ✅ Added status indicators for pending tasks
- ✅ Updated acceptance criteria
- ✅ Added current status section

## The Blocker: iOS Credential Setup Required

### What Happened
When attempting to run `.deployment/build-preview.sh`, EAS Build reported:
```
Distribution Certificate is not validated for non-interactive builds.
Failed to set up credentials.
Credentials are not set up. Run this command again in interactive mode.
```

### Why This Happens
- **First-Time Setup:** EAS needs to generate iOS distribution certificates and provisioning profiles the first time
- **Interactive Mode Required:** This process requires authenticating with your Apple Account
- **Non-Interactive Limitation:** The `--non-interactive` flag in the script cannot complete credential setup automatically

### This Is Normal
This is standard EAS behavior for first-time builds. After the initial interactive credential setup, all subsequent builds (including GitHub Actions) will work non-interactively.

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Run First Interactive Build (Recommended)

Open your terminal and run:
```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

You will be prompted for:
1. Apple Account login (use: chaves.augusto@gmail.com)
2. Apple Account password
3. Two-factor authentication code (if enabled)

EAS will then:
- Generate distribution certificate
- Generate provisioning profile
- Store credentials on EAS servers
- Complete the build (15-30 minutes)

**Detailed instructions:** See `CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md` in this directory

### Step 2: Resume Task Group 12

After the interactive build completes successfully:

```bash
# Trigger build via script (should work now)
.deployment/build-preview.sh

# Capture the build ID that gets printed
# Example output: "iOS Build ID: abc123xyz"

# Wait for build and submit to TestFlight
.deployment/submit-testflight.sh abc123xyz
```

### Step 3: Verify TestFlight Submission

- Check TestFlight in App Store Connect
- Build should appear within 5-10 minutes after submission
- Install on iOS device for testing

## Alternative: Use eas credentials Command

Instead of running the build interactively, you can configure credentials separately:

```bash
# Configure credentials
eas credentials --platform ios

# Follow the prompts to generate certificate and provisioning profile

# Then run the build script
.deployment/build-preview.sh
```

## Time Estimates

- **Credential setup (interactive):** 10-15 minutes
- **First build completion:** 15-30 minutes
- **TestFlight submission:** 5-10 minutes
- **Testing on device:** 10-15 minutes
- **Total:** ~45-70 minutes

## What This Unlocks

Once credentials are configured:

### ✅ Automated Local Builds
- `.deployment/build-preview.sh` works without interaction
- `.deployment/submit-testflight.sh` handles waiting and submission
- Scripts can be used in CI/CD pipelines

### ✅ GitHub Actions Workflows
- "Expo Preview Build" workflow will work
- "Expo Production Build" workflow will work
- All builds run non-interactively with stored credentials

### ✅ Team Access
- All team members with project access can trigger builds
- No need for each developer to configure credentials
- Credentials stored securely on EAS servers

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Do I need to do this again for production builds?
**A:** No. The same credentials are used for all build profiles (development, preview, production).

### Q: What if I don't have access to the Apple Account?
**A:** You need the Apple Developer account credentials (chaves.augusto@gmail.com) to complete this setup. If you don't have access, contact the account owner.

### Q: Can I skip this and just use GitHub Actions?
**A:** No. GitHub Actions will encounter the same credential issue. Interactive setup must be completed once before any automated builds will work.

### Q: How long do these credentials last?
**A:** Distribution certificates expire after 1 year. EAS will notify you before expiration, and renewal follows a similar process.

### Q: Is this secure?
**A:** Yes. Credentials are stored encrypted on EAS servers and never committed to your repository. Access is controlled through your Expo organization membership.

### Q: What about Android builds?
**A:** Android builds don't have this issue. EAS can generate Android keystores automatically without interactive setup.

## Next Steps Checklist

- [ ] Read `CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Run `eas build --platform ios --profile preview`
- [ ] Authenticate with Apple Account when prompted
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (15-30 minutes)
- [ ] Verify credentials: `eas credentials --platform ios`
- [ ] Test script: `.deployment/build-preview.sh`
- [ ] Test submission: `.deployment/submit-testflight.sh <build-id>`
- [ ] Verify build appears in TestFlight
- [ ] Install and test on iOS device
- [ ] Mark tasks 12.1, 12.2, 12.3 as complete in `tasks.md`

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check `CREDENTIAL-SETUP-GUIDE.md` troubleshooting section
2. Review EAS documentation: https://docs.expo.dev/app-signing/managed-credentials/
3. Check Apple Developer account status
4. Verify App Store Connect access

## Summary

Task Group 12 successfully identified the credential setup prerequisite and provided comprehensive documentation for completing it. This is a one-time setup that unlocks fully automated builds going forward.

**Current Status:** Ready for user to complete interactive credential setup

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 45-70 minutes total

**Next Action:** Run `eas build --platform ios --profile preview`
