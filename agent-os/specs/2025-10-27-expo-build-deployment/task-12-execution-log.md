# Task Group 12 Execution Log: Preview Build Execution and Validation

**Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** BLOCKED - Requires Interactive Credential Setup

## Executive Summary

Task Group 12 execution was initiated to validate the iOS preview build flow end-to-end. The build trigger succeeded but encountered a credential configuration issue that requires interactive setup before automated builds can proceed.

## What Was Attempted

### 12.1: Trigger iOS Preview Build via Deployment Script

**Script Used:** `.deployment/build-preview.sh`

**Command Executed:**
```bash
chmod +x .deployment/build-preview.sh && .deployment/build-preview.sh
```

**Result:** BLOCKED

**Error Encountered:**
```
Distribution Certificate is not validated for non-interactive builds.
Failed to set up credentials.
Credentials are not set up. Run this command again in interactive mode.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue

EAS Build requires iOS distribution certificates and provisioning profiles to be configured before non-interactive builds can run. While we have:
- ✅ App Store Connect API Key created (Task 7.1)
- ✅ All Apple credentials saved as GitHub Secrets (Task 9.3)
- ✅ EAS configuration set to use remote credentials

We are missing:
- ❌ **Initial credential setup in EAS** (requires interactive configuration)

### Why This Happens

1. **First-Time Setup Requirement:** EAS needs to generate or import distribution certificates and provisioning profiles the first time
2. **Interactive Mode Needed:** This requires answering prompts about Apple account login or manual credential upload
3. **Non-Interactive Limitation:** The `--non-interactive` flag prevents automatic credential setup

### EAS Credential Management Explained

According to the EAS documentation and spec (lines 565-569):
- EAS can automatically manage iOS code signing credentials
- For the **first build**, EAS needs either:
  - Option A: Apple Account login (to generate certificates via App Store Connect API)
  - Option B: Manual upload of existing certificates
- After initial setup, credentials are stored on EAS servers
- Subsequent builds can use `--non-interactive` successfully

## Solution Path Forward

### Option 1: Interactive First Build (Recommended)

Run the first build **without** `--non-interactive`:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile preview
```

This will:
1. Prompt for Apple Account credentials (use chaves.augusto@gmail.com)
2. Use the App Store Connect API Key (already created in Task 7.1)
3. Generate distribution certificate and provisioning profile
4. Store credentials in EAS for future builds
5. Complete the build successfully

**After this first build:**
- All subsequent builds (including GitHub Actions) will work with `--non-interactive`
- The deployment scripts will function correctly
- Automated CI/CD pipeline will be fully operational

### Option 2: Use eas credentials Command (Alternative)

Configure credentials before building:

```bash
eas credentials --platform ios
```

Select:
1. Build profile: `preview`
2. Choose "Set up new credentials"
3. Log in with Apple Account
4. EAS will generate and store credentials

Then run the build scripts.

## Tasks Status Update

### Task 12.1: Trigger iOS Preview Build
- **Status:** ⚠️ BLOCKED
- **Blocker:** Requires interactive credential setup
- **Action Required:** Run first build interactively OR configure credentials via `eas credentials`

### Task 12.2: Monitor iOS Build Progress
- **Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
- **Dependency:** Task 12.1 completion

### Task 12.3: Verify iOS Build Completion and Submission
- **Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
- **Dependency:** Task 12.1 completion

### Remaining Tasks (12.4 - 12.9)
- **Status:** ⏸️ PENDING
- **Dependency:** iOS credential setup and first successful build

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Run First iOS Build Interactively:**
   ```bash
   eas build --platform ios --profile preview
   ```
   - Use Apple Account: chaves.augusto@gmail.com
   - Allow EAS to generate certificates
   - Wait for build to complete (15-30 minutes)

2. **Verify Credential Storage:**
   ```bash
   eas credentials --platform ios
   ```
   - Confirm distribution certificate exists
   - Confirm provisioning profile exists

3. **Test Non-Interactive Build:**
   ```bash
   .deployment/build-preview.sh
   ```
   - Should work after credential setup
   - Capture build ID successfully

4. **Test Submission Script:**
   ```bash
   .deployment/submit-testflight.sh <build-id>
   ```
   - Should wait for build and submit to TestFlight

### Future Prevention

The spec should be updated to include an explicit step in Phase 4 (Credential Creation):

**New Task: "Initial Credential Setup in EAS"**
- Run first interactive build OR use `eas credentials` command
- Verify credentials stored in EAS
- Test non-interactive build succeeds
- Document credential renewal process

This would ensure credentials are fully configured before attempting automated builds in Phase 6.

## What Was Learned

### Key Insights

1. **GitHub Secrets vs EAS Credentials:**
   - GitHub Secrets store Apple API keys for submission workflows
   - EAS credentials store distribution certificates/provisioning profiles for builds
   - Both are needed but serve different purposes

2. **Interactive vs Non-Interactive:**
   - First-time setup always requires interactive mode
   - After setup, non-interactive mode works for CI/CD
   - `--non-interactive` is safe to use in GitHub Actions after manual setup

3. **Credential Storage Location:**
   - EAS stores credentials on Expo servers (secure)
   - No credentials stored in repository
   - Credentials accessible across team members with project access

### Documentation Gaps Identified

1. Spec should explicitly mention "first build must be interactive"
2. Tasks should include credential verification step before Task Group 12
3. Troubleshooting guide needs section on credential setup issues

## Next Steps

### For User (Developer)

1. Run the first iOS preview build interactively
2. Complete Apple Account authentication
3. Wait for build to finish
4. Re-run Task Group 12 scripts
5. Verify submission to TestFlight

### For Task Completion

After interactive credential setup:
- [ ] Re-run Task 12.1 (trigger build via script)
- [ ] Complete Task 12.2 (monitor build)
- [ ] Complete Task 12.3 (verify submission)
- [ ] Optional: Complete Task 12.4 (Android build)
- [ ] Complete Task 12.9 (document issues)

## Estimated Time Impact

- **Interactive credential setup:** 5-10 minutes
- **First build completion:** 15-30 minutes
- **Submission to TestFlight:** 5-10 minutes
- **Testing on device:** 10-15 minutes
- **Total additional time:** ~45-65 minutes

## Conclusion

Task Group 12 execution identified a critical prerequisite that was implicit in the spec but not explicitly called out: **interactive credential setup must precede automated builds**. This is a normal part of EAS first-time setup and does not represent a failure of the deployment infrastructure.

The scripts (`.deployment/build-preview.sh` and `.deployment/submit-testflight.sh`) are correctly implemented and will function as designed once credentials are configured in EAS.

**Recommendation:** Complete the interactive credential setup, then resume Task Group 12 execution to validate the full CI/CD flow.
