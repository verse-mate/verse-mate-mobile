## Code commenting best practices

- **Self-Documenting Code**: Write code that explains itself through clear structure and naming
- **Minimal, helpful comments**: Add concise, minimal comments to explain large sections of code logic.
- **Don't comment changes or fixes**: Do not leave code comments that speak to recent or temporary changes or fixes. Comments should be evergreen informational texts that are relevant far into the future.
